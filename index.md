## A new site is under construction

HiðŸ‘‹, we are updating the Sneeland(fan's backup version) website and mainly adding online reading function without download. Need several days. And the webside is more easier to share uncompressed images(We got many new archivesðŸ˜ƒ).

By the way, the new website looks familiar...ðŸ˜‰

## Welcome to SneeLand

Here is an archive of works that Sneefee produced and made public from 2007 to 2017. This site and the archives are hosted on Github for free.

The source of this archive data is Sneefee's personal website (`http://www.sneefee.com`). The website was shut down in 2017 and the archive comes from a backup of the site by fans before the shutdown. You can still query some website records from [Waybackmachine](http://web.archive.org/web/20160330125448/http://sneefee.com/).
