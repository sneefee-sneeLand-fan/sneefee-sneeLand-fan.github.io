Since I can not contact you for permission, please email to\u00a0backblackto0#gmail.com\u00a0if you don\u2019t want this site to exhibit your works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, in 2012 I touched your BNB for the first time and I loved it immediately. At that time, I was confused about my gay identity as a middle school student and I was afraid that my families and friends wouldn&#8217;t accept me, though I was a freak. So I could only hide my emotion even though I loved some boys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through your BNB comic, I learned that I\u2019m not the only gay person in the world and there are many people who accept and tolerate LGBTQ+ just like Splinter in BNB. And I took courage to show my identity to my friends, which let me made many true friends. It really changed my life and made me decide to find a free country for LGBTQ+ to live. I\u2019m working on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, thank you Sneefee\/Lesnee! I really hope you can continue creating amazing works, but I also respect your decision. Hope you can protect yourself during COVID-19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best wish,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admin<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi Sneefee or Lesnee, I\u2019m admin of Sneeland (fans\u2019 backup version) website.After you left TMNT and deleted accounts, I made this site to exhibit your works I collected.
